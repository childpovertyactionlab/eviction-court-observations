The eviction suit was brought by the father and mother, Manuel and Emilia Ruiz, against their youngest son, Mario Ruiz. The father, Manuel, is the legal owner of the property and holds title under a life estate interest as the result of a 'ladybird' deed signed a year ago. Both parties were represented by counsel, the court admitted several documents as evidence and multiple witnesses were examined and cross-examined. The issue stems from a falling out between the daughter-in-law of Manuel and Emilia Ruiz. The elderly Ruiz couple had been living with Mario and his family for some time until the falling out. Mario Ruiz himself had been residing at the property since 2009. The house in question, located at 4708 Lizzy Lane Dallas, Texas, was originally purchased in the early 2000's by the eldest son of Manuel Ruiz and later conveyed to Manuel Ruiz. By agreement, the youngest son became a tenant in 2009 and began paying the mortgage, other expenses and doing work on the home. Within the past few years, Manuel and Emilia executed an enhanced life estate deed, a/k/a ladybird deed, and lived with Mario, his wife and their two young daughters. Following the disagreement, Maro's wife claimed that they held ownership of the property and for some unknown reason, Mario's parents, Manuel and Emilia, moved out of the home and have been living with their eldest son, Juan Carlos. Juan Carlos, who originally purchased the property and conveyed to his elderly father, filed suit for eviction on behalf of his parents. In the hearing, the mother claimed that she did not know what she was signing when she signed the ladybird deed and the plaintiff's attorney provided evidence showing that the plaintiff's had revoked the enhanced life estate deed properly under Texas law. There was an interpreter present as all parties spoke limited English. Ultimately, the judge ruled in favor of the plaintiff and set an eviction date for the following Tuesday, but emphasized that the eviction would be stayed if the defendant and their counsel appealed to the Dallas County Court at Law. 

Judge Jasso made the only ruling he could in this case because it was clear that the father, Manuel Ruiz, validly and legally held title to the property, although the plaintiff also presented medical records showing the father had Alzheimer's, and that Manuel and his wife, acting under a limited power of attorney, had properly revoked the enhanced life estate deed. As the elderly Ruiz couple were the proper title holders, the defendant could not properly establish ownership over the property. As a result, Mario Ruiz, his wife and two young daughters are at risk of eviction unless they filed an appeal. 

After listening to the witnesses and evidence, I believe the defendant's attorney should have also argued that (1) the plaintiff and defendant had an oral contract for the sale of the property and (2) under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, it would be unjust to evict the defendant, as he had essentially paid the mortgage and other costs for the home over the past decade. Although oral agreements for the conveyance of land are precluded under the statute of frauds, there is a well established exception, the Part Performance Doctrine, which pulls contracts out of the statute of frauds where the purchaser is able to show that they've paid good and valuable consideration towards the property, manage the property as would be expected of the property owner and made improvements to the property. That the parents or the sellers continue to reside with the owner does not in itself defeat a claim to title. I cannot fathom why the defendant's counsel centered their case on the enhanced life estate deed since this deed is revocable under Texas law. However, given that the plaintiff submitted evidence and testified that they were unclear as to what they were signing, perhaps an argument can be made that the deed was void or voidable. Alternately, the plaintiff might have argued that a quasi-contract was formed and the plaintiff's breached the contract by seeking eviction. Under this theory, the defendant would have a claim under promissory estoppel for unjust enrichment as the defendant has been paying the plaintiff's mortgage for nearly a decade. Of course, if those monies are classified as rent, then the defendant's argument may not stand up. In either case, the defendant and their two young children have very little time to arrange a new place to live although, it was suggested in the proceedings that the elder brother and the parents would assist them with finding new arrangements.
