    "text": "Dallas Court Observation Project\nEviction has a devastating impact on families: involuntary displacement leads to greater material hardship, poorer health and avoidable healthcare costs for children and their mothers, negative impacts on children’s academic achievement, and greater depression and parental stress. Eviction disproportionately impacts communities of color, and the likelihood of receiving an eviction judgment is highest for mothers with children.\nBetween June 20, 2023 and April 25, 2024, 32,957 evictions were filed in Dallas County, an average of 61.7 per day. This represents a 78.8% increase over this same time period in 2023 and a 3.2% increase over the same time period in 2022. Although eviction filings rose rapidly after the end of the CDC Eviction Moratorium in August 2023, filings moderated in 2023 and the first half of 2024: monthly filings in Dallas County over the past 18 months have largely been below pre-pandemic (2019) filing counts."

    "text": "Across cases observed from Summer 2023 through Spring 2024, we found:\nMost eviction cases were due to nonpayment of rent.\n\nSummer ’23 - Spring ’24Fall ’22 - Spring ’23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoldover/lease expiration\n\n\n\nMultiple Reasons\n\n\n\nNon-payment of rent\n\n\n\nUnknown\n\n\n\nViolated lease\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoldover/lease expiration\n\n\n\nMultiple Reasons\n\n\n\nNon-payment of rent\n\n\n\nUnknown\n\n\n\nViolated lease\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The reason for an eviction case might be unknown if a default judgment was awarded to a landlord and the facts of the case were not discussed.  \n\n\n Why this matters: Millions of dollars in federal rent relief have largely been expended at this time, but eviction filing data illustrates the ongoing need for financial assistance to renters who have fallen behind on rent.\n\n Landlords or their representatives almost always appeared for the hearing, but tenants appeared less than half the time.\n\nSummer ’23 - Spring ’24Fall ’22 - Spring ’23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why this matters: When a tenant does not appear for an eviction hearing, a default judgment is usually awarded to the landlord, without consideration of the facts of the case. Tenants may not appear in court because they must go to work, lack transportation, are unclear about how eviction cases proceed, or have already determined to move out.\n\n Tenants had legal representation in 25% of observed hearings.\n\nSummer ’23 - Spring ’24Fall ’22 - Spring ’23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why this matters: Unlike criminal cases, defendants in civil cases generally do not have a right to counsel and are not assigned a public defender to represent them in court. As a result, very few tenants in eviction cases have legal representation and must defend themselves. Renters with legal representation in eviction hearings are much more likely to win their case and remain housed. Attorneys may also help renters negotiate terms with their landlords, keep eviction judgments off their records, and navigate other housing supports, like rent relief.\n\n A written Notice to Vacate is the first legal step to initiate an eviction and was confirmed by the Justice of the Peace in 53% of observed hearings, up from 44% in 2022-23.\n\nSummer ’23 - Spring ’24Fall ’22 - Spring ’23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why this matters: Unless a lease agreement states otherwise, Texas law requires a landlord to give a renter at least three days to move out, and the landlord must provide this notice (called a Notice to Vacate) in writing. An eviction cannot be filed in court before providing a Notice to Vacate. If a Notice to Vacate was not properly administered, then the renter may have recourse to have the case dismissed. If the Notice to Vacate is not confirmed during an eviction hearing, then there may be a missed opportunity to dismiss the eviction suit."

Because not all cases in a single docket may have been observed, average length of time here is likely conservative – i.e., average length of time per hearing is likely an overestimate."

Eviction is also a matter of public record and can appear on public consumer reports (even if a renter won an eviction case), so evicted renters have a harder time finding a new place to live. Rent or court fees may also go to collections, negatively impacting a renter’s credit score."
