    "text": "Eviction has a devastating impact on families: involuntary displacement leads to greater material hardship, poorer health and avoidable healthcare costs for children and their mothers, negative impacts on children’s academic achievement, and greater depression and parental stress. Eviction disproportionately impacts communities of color, and the likelihood of receiving an eviction judgment is highest for mothers with children.\nBetween November 1, 2022 and April 20, 2023, 18,485 evictions were filed in Dallas County, an average of 95.7 per day. This represents a 11.8% change over this same time period in 2022 and a 142.4% change over the same time period in 2021. Evictions have been on the rise since the end of the CDC Eviction Moratorium in August 2021, and Dallas County realized its highest one-month filing total in at least five years in August 2022, with 3,815 evictions filed."

    "text": "Across the 1,277 observed cases, we found:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The reason for an eviction case might be unknown if a default judgment was awarded to a landlord and the facts of the case were not discussed. Reasons are rounded to the nearest whole number, so totals may not equal 100%.\n\n Why this matters: Millions of dollars in federal rent relief have largely been expended at this time, but eviction filing data illustrates the ongoing need for financial assistance to renters who have fallen behind on rent.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why this matters: When a tenant does not appear for an eviction hearing, a default judgment is usually awarded to the landlord, without consideration of the facts of the case. Tenants may not appear in court because they must go to work, lack transportation, are unclear about how eviction cases proceed, or have already determined to move out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*In Spring 2023 in JP 1-1, tenants had legal representation XX% of the time.\n\n Why this matters: : Unlike criminal cases, defendants in civil cases generally do not have a right to counsel and are not assigned a public defender to represent them in court. As a result, very few tenants in eviction cases have legal representation and must defend themselves. Renters with legal representation in eviction hearings are much more likely to win their case and remain housed. Attorneys may also help renters negotiate terms with their landlords, keep eviction judgments off their records, and navigate other housing supports, like rent relief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*In Spring 2023 in JP 1-1, a Notice to Vacate was confirmed 35% of the time.\n\n Why this matters: Unless a lease agreement states otherwise, Texas law requires a landlord to give a renter at least three days to move out, and the landlord must provide this notice (called a Notice to Vacate) in writing. An eviction cannot be filed in court before providing a Notice to Vacate. If a Notice to Vacate was not properly administered, then the renter may have recourse to have the case dismissed. If the Notice to Vacate is not confirmed during an eviction hearing, then there may be a missed opportunity to dismiss the eviction suit.\n\n\n jpCourt CasesObs AvgCaseLength\n     1-1      377           3.3\n     1-2       17           3.3\n     3-1      439           3.9\n     4-1       51           4.3\n     5-1      393           3.5\n   Total    1,277           3.6\n\n\n\nAverage hearing length calculated by (1) counting the number of cases observed in each docket, including default judgments, (2) calculating the total time of the docket (end time - start time), (3) calculating the average length of each hearing by dividing docket time by number of cases observed, and then (4) calculating a weighted average across all observed dockets. Because not all cases in a single docket may have been observed, average length of time here is likely conservative – i.e., average length of time per hearing is likely an overestimate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcomes are rounded to the nearest whole number, so totals may not equal 100%.\n\n Why this matters:\n\nOutcomes are rounded to the nearest whole number, so totals may not equal 100%\n\n Why this matters: Evicted low-income renters face a host of consequences: eviction increases the risk of homelessness, elevates long-term residential instability, and increases emergency room use. Eviction is also a matter of public record and can appear on public consumer reports (even if a renter won an eviction case), so evicted renters have a harder time finding a new place to live. Rent or court fees may also go to collections, negatively impacting a renter’s credit score."
