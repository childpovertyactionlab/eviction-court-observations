    "text": "CONTEXT\nEviction has a devastating impact on families: involuntary displacement leads to greater material hardship, poorer health and avoidable healthcare costs for children and their mothers, negative impacts on children’s academic achievement, and greater depression and parental stress. Eviction disproportionately impacts communities of color, and the likelihood of receiving an eviction judgment is highest for mothers with children.\nThrough August 2022, 200,000 evictions have been filed in Dallas County, an average of 200 per day. This represents a 20% increase over the same time period in 2021 and a 20% increase over the same time period in 2020. Evictions have been on the rise since the end of the CDC Eviction Moratorium in August 2021, and Dallas County realized its highest one-month filing total in at least five years in Month Year, with 5,000 evictions filed.\n\n\nCOURT PROCESS\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Step One] --&gt; B(Step Two)\n  B --&gt; C{Court Appearance}\n  C --&gt; D[Result]\n  C --&gt; E[Result Outcome]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROJECT BACKGROUND\nIn spring 2021, the Child Poverty Action Lab (CPAL) launched a court observation project to collect, analyze, and share eviction-related data not otherwise reported publicly. Eviction docket court observation has been ongoing since, with the purpose of (1) improving local understanding of how eviction unfolds, (2) uncovering barriers/challenges for tenants and landlords, and (3) identifying ways to better support tenants and landlords upstream of an eviction hearing. Observation first began in Dallas County Justice of the Peace Court 1-1 and expanded to Dallas County Justice of the Peace Courts 3-1 and 5-1 in 2022.\n\n\nCOURT OBSERVATION PROTOCOL\nThe court observation project is powered by volunteer observers who attend eviction dockets in-person, take notes as eviction cases are heard, and then enter the data digitally for CPAL analysis. Since late 2021, volunteer observers have all been SMU Dedman School of Law students, primarily in their second or third year of law school, volunteering as part of a class requirement or to fulfill public service hours. CPAL staff on-board volunteer observers through a two-part training: the first is an introductory online session to explain the eviction process, and the second is an onsite session at a Justice of the Peace court focused on data collection through observation.\nOnce trained, volunteers sign-up for dockets to observe using a digital scheduler. Volunteers select dockets to observe based on their availability, so observed cases do not represent a random selection. During docket observations, volunteers take notes on cases heard using a paper template and then enter the data afterwards into a Google Form created and managed by CPAL. Before analysis and reporting, CPAL reviews and cleans the data, as needed."

    "text": "SUMMER 2023 FINDINGS\nFrom June 1, 2022 through August 5, 2022, nine SMU Law student volunteers observed 1,135 cases: 464 in Justice of the Peace Court 1-1, 344 in Justice of the Peace Court 3-1, and 327 in Justice of the Peace Court 5-1. The 1,135 observed cases represent 32% coverage of all initially scheduled hearings in 1-1, 3-1, and 5-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage\n\n\nChart 3\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n12  12  12 \n                                 12 &lt;br&gt;\n                                 12 &lt;br&gt;\n                                 12 &lt;br&gt;\n12  12  12 \n12 &lt;br&gt;  |  12 &lt;br&gt;\n12 &lt;br&gt;  |  12 &lt;br&gt;\n12 &lt;br&gt;  |  12 &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n*The ‘scheduled hearings’ indicator was calculated based on the hearing date set at the time of the eviction filing. If a hearing date was subsequently rescheduled for a date later than August 5, then the case is still included here in the ‘scheduled hearings’ count. Some scheduled hearings may have been dismissed in advance of the docket, so ‘coverage’ here is likely an underrepresentation of cases observed relative to the number of cases heard during a docket.\nAcross the 1,135 observed cases, we found:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage\n\n\nChart 3\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n12  12  12 \n                                 12 &lt;br&gt;\n                                 12 &lt;br&gt;\n                                 12 &lt;br&gt;\n12  12  12 \n12 &lt;br&gt;  |  12 &lt;br&gt;\n12 &lt;br&gt;  |  12 &lt;br&gt;\n12 &lt;br&gt;  |  12 &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n*The reason for an eviction case might be unknown if a default judgment was awarded to a landlord and the facts of the case were not discussed. Reasons are rounded to the nearest whole number, so totals may not equal 100%.\n Why this matters: In Dallas County, millions of dollars for rent relief have been available throughout the pandemic. Eviction cases due to nonpayment of rent might have been remedied had the renter and landlord been aware of and able to easily access rent relief programs."
