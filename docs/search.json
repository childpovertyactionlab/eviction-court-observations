    "text": "CONTEXT\nEviction has a devastating impact on families: involuntary displacement leads to greater material hardship, poorer health and avoidable healthcare costs for children and their mothers, negative impacts on children’s academic achievement, and greater depression and parental stress. Eviction disproportionately impacts communities of color, and the likelihood of receiving an eviction judgment is highest for mothers with children.\nBetween November 1, 2022 and April 20, 2023, 18,485 evictions have been filed in Dallas County, an average of 108.7 per day. This represents a 3.2% change over the same time period in 2022 and a 117.5% change over the same time period in 2021. Evictions have been on the rise since the end of the CDC Eviction Moratorium in August 2021, and Dallas County realized its highest one-month filing total in at least five years in August 2022, with 4,355 evictions filed.\n\n\nCOURT PROCESS\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Eviction Filed by Landlord] --&gt; B(Tenant Receives Notice)\n  B --&gt; C{Case Date within X days}\n  C --&gt; D[Hearing Held]\n  D --&gt; E[Case Outcome]\n  E --&gt; F{Filed in Favor of Landlord}\n  E --&gt; G{Filed in Favor of Tenant}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROJECT BACKGROUND\nIn spring 2021, the Child Poverty Action Lab (CPAL) launched a court observation project to collect, analyze, and share eviction-related data not otherwise reported publicly. Eviction docket court observation has been ongoing since, with the purpose of (1) improving local understanding of how eviction unfolds, (2) uncovering barriers/challenges for tenants and landlords, and (3) identifying ways to better support tenants and landlords upstream of an eviction hearing. Observation first began in Dallas County Justice of the Peace Court 1-1 and expanded to Dallas County Justice of the Peace Courts 3-1 and 5-1 in 2022.\n\n\nCOURT OBSERVATION PROTOCOL\nThe court observation project is powered by volunteer observers who attend eviction dockets in-person, take notes as eviction cases are heard, and then enter the data digitally for CPAL analysis. Since late 2021, volunteer observers have all been SMU Dedman School of Law students, primarily in their second or third year of law school, volunteering as part of a class requirement or to fulfill public service hours. CPAL staff on-board volunteer observers through a two-part training: the first is an introductory online session to explain the eviction process, and the second is an onsite session at a Justice of the Peace court focused on data collection through observation.\nOnce trained, volunteers sign-up for dockets to observe using a digital scheduler. Volunteers select dockets to observe based on their availability, so observed cases do not represent a random selection. During docket observations, volunteers take notes on cases heard using a paper template and then enter the data afterwards into a Google Form created and managed by CPAL. Before analysis and reporting, CPAL reviews and cleans the data, as needed."

    "text": "SUMMER 2023 FINDINGS\nFrom June 1, 2022 through August 5, 2022, nine SMU Law student volunteers observed 1,135 cases: 464 in Justice of the Peace Court 1-1, 344 in Justice of the Peace Court 3-1, and 327 in Justice of the Peace Court 5-1. The 1,135 observed cases represent 32% coverage of all initially scheduled hearings in 1-1, 3-1, and 5-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage\n\n\nChart 3\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n12  12  12 \n                                 12 &lt;br&gt;\n                                 12 &lt;br&gt;\n                                 12 &lt;br&gt;\n12  12  12 \n12 &lt;br&gt;  |  12 &lt;br&gt;\n12 &lt;br&gt;  |  12 &lt;br&gt;\n12 &lt;br&gt;  |  12 &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n*The ‘scheduled hearings’ indicator was calculated based on the hearing date set at the time of the eviction filing. If a hearing date was subsequently rescheduled for a date later than August 5, then the case is still included here in the ‘scheduled hearings’ count. Some scheduled hearings may have been dismissed in advance of the docket, so ‘coverage’ here is likely an underrepresentation of cases observed relative to the number of cases heard during a docket.\nAcross the 1,135 observed cases, we found:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage\n\n\nChart 3\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n12  12  12 \n                                 12 &lt;br&gt;\n                                 12 &lt;br&gt;\n                                 12 &lt;br&gt;\n12  12  12 \n12 &lt;br&gt;  |  12 &lt;br&gt;\n12 &lt;br&gt;  |  12 &lt;br&gt;\n12 &lt;br&gt;  |  12 &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n*The reason for an eviction case might be unknown if a default judgment was awarded to a landlord and the facts of the case were not discussed. Reasons are rounded to the nearest whole number, so totals may not equal 100%.\n Why this matters: In Dallas County, millions of dollars for rent relief have been available throughout the pandemic. Eviction cases due to nonpayment of rent might have been remedied had the renter and landlord been aware of and able to easily access rent relief programs."

    "text": "From 2022-11-01 through 2023-04-20, 17 SMU Law student volunteers observed 1281 cases: 377 in Justice of the Peace Court 1-1, 439 in Justice of the Peace Court 3-1, and 393 in Justice of the Peace Court 5-1. The 1281 observed cases represent 12.6% coverage of all initially scheduled hearings in 1-1, 3-1, and 5-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The ‘scheduled hearings’ indicator was calculated based on the hearing date set at the time of the eviction filing.

The arrow here shows change from fall 2022 data collection. E.g., in summer 2023, tenants appeared 48% of the time in JP 1-1, but in fall 2022, tenants appeared 59% of the time.\n\n Why this matters: When a tenant does not appear for an eviction hearing, a default judgment is usually awarded to the landlord, without consideration of the facts of the case. Tenants may not appear in court because they must go to work, lack transportation, are unclear about how eviction cases proceed, or have already determined to move out.\nFOURTH TABLE GOES HERE\n\n*In fall 2021 in JP 1-1, tenants had legal representation 8% of the time.\n\n Why this matters: : Unlike criminal cases, defendants in civil cases generally do not have a right to counsel and are not assigned a public defender to represent them in court. As a result, very few tenants in eviction cases have legal representation and must defend themselves. Renters with legal representation in eviction hearings are much more likely to win their case and remain housed. Attorneys may also help renters negotiate terms with their landlords, keep eviction judgments off their records, and navigate other housing supports, like rent relief.\nFIFTH TABLE GOES HERE\n\n*In fall 2021 in JP 1-1, a Notice to Vacate was confirmed 40% of the time.\n\n Why this matters: Unless a lease agreement states otherwise, Texas law requires a landlord to give a renter at least three days to move out, and the landlord must provide this notice (called a Notice to Vacate) in writing. An eviction cannot be filed in court before providing a Notice to Vacate. If a Notice to Vacate was not properly administered, then the renter may have recourse to have the case dismissed. If the Notice to Vacate is not confirmed during an eviction hearing, then there may be a missed opportunity to dismiss the eviction suit.\nTABLE GOES HERE\n\nAverage hearing length calculated by (1) counting the number of cases observed in each docket, including default judgments, (2) calculating the total time of the docket (end time - start time), (3) calculating the average length of each hearing by dividing docket time by number of cases observed, and then (4) calculating a weighted average across all observed dockets. Because not all cases in a single docket may have been observed, average length of time here is likely conservative – i.e., average length of time per hearing is likely an overestimate.\n\nTABLE GOES HERE\n\nOutcomes are rounded to the nearest whole number, so totals may not equal 100%.\n\n Why this matters:\nTABLE GOES HERE\n\nOutcomes are rounded to the nearest whole number, so totals may not equal 100%\n\n Why this matters: Evicted low-income renters face a host of consequences: eviction increases the risk of homelessness, elevates long-term residential instability, and increases emergency room use. Eviction is also a matter of public record and can appear on public consumer reports (even if a renter won an eviction case), so evicted renters have a harder time finding a new place to live. Rent or court fees may also go to collections, negatively impacting a renter’s credit score.\n\n\n\nTABLE GOES HERE\n\n\n\nTABLE GOES HERE"
