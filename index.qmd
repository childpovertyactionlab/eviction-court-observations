# CONTEXT

Eviction has a devastating impact on families: involuntary displacement leads to greater material
hardship, poorer health and avoidable healthcare costs for children and their mothers, negative
impacts on childrenâ€™s academic achievement, and greater depression and parental stress. Eviction
disproportionately impacts communities of color, and the likelihood of receiving an eviction judgment is
highest for mothers with children.

Through August 2022, **`r paste(totalevic)`** evictions have been filed in Dallas County, an average of **`r paste(avgevic)`** per day.
This represents a **`r paste(evicchange)`** increase over the same time period in 2021 and a **`r paste(evicchange)`** increase over the same
time period in 2020. Evictions have been on the rise since the end of the CDC Eviction Moratorium in
August 2021, and Dallas County realized its highest one-month filing total in at least five years in **`r paste(highestdate)`**, with **`r paste(highestevic)`** evictions filed.

# PROJECT BACKGROUND

In spring 2021, the Child Poverty Action Lab (CPAL) launched a court observation project to collect,
analyze, and share eviction-related data not otherwise reported publicly. Eviction docket court observation
has been ongoing since, with the purpose of (1) improving local understanding of how eviction unfolds,
(2) uncovering barriers/challenges for tenants and landlords, and (3) identifying ways to better support
tenants and landlords upstream of an eviction hearing. Observation first began in Dallas County Justice
of the Peace Court 1-1 and expanded to Dallas County Justice of the Peace Courts 3-1 and 5-1 in 2022.

# COURT OBSERVATION PROTOCOL

The court observation project is powered by volunteer observers who attend eviction dockets in-person,
take notes as eviction cases are heard, and then enter the data digitally for CPAL analysis. Since late
2021, volunteer observers have all been SMU Dedman School of Law students, primarily in their second
or third year of law school, volunteering as part of a class requirement or to fulfill public service hours.
CPAL staff on-board volunteer observers through a two-part training: the first is an introductory online
session to explain the eviction process, and the second is an onsite session at a Justice of the Peace
court focused on data collection through observation.

Once trained, volunteers sign-up for dockets to observe using a digital scheduler. Volunteers select
dockets to observe based on their availability, so observed cases do not represent a random selection.
During docket observations, volunteers take notes on cases heard using a paper template and then enter
the data afterwards into a Google Form created and managed by CPAL. Before analysis and reporting,
CPAL reviews and cleans the data, as needed.
